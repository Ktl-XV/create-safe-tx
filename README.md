> ðŸ“œ Useful script to build complex Gnosis Safe transactions involving Gnosis Multisend and/or Zodiac modifiers

## Getting started

```bash
npx create-safe-tx
```

`create-safe-tx` will output the contents of your freshly-built Safe transaction into `tx.json`

Hand it over either to Safe's backend, or to [`morpho-labs/safer`](https://github.com/morpho-labs/safer) in order to submit it onchain!
